# Multi-user graphic board
Web app for many users to draw on the same board

## Description

You may run the application and begin to draw by the simple 'pen'. You may choose the color of the line and you can erase. what was drown

Due to the app being in unfinished state, you may face some troubles: you and your friend can connect to the online-board at the different time, but you have to start drawing at he same time^ jr else, you wouldn't be able to see, what was drawn previously.
Also there is the function allowing to erase everithing on the screen - but it's working only for the client, server will still have everything that was drawn before. So if you need to start the picture from the scratch, you would have to agree on this with your partner.



The application was developed to train the skills in web-programming, web-sockets and client-server interaction.
